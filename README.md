# Trip Ninja SDK

The Trip Ninja Python SDK is used for interacting with the Trip Ninja API 
through a easy-to-use library and suite of tools.

## Installing

**Python 3.10 or higher is required**

### Linux/MacOS
```
python3 -m pip install -U tn_sdk
```

### Windows

py -3 -m pip install -U tn_sdk
```


## Quick Example

```python
import tn_sdk

tn_client = tn_sdk.TnApi()

# Development

## Setup

From an active virtual env, `cd` into the directory
```
pip install -e .
```

> `-e` installs it in [editable](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs) mode. 
> Meaning it will update as you modify the source code without having to re-run the installation command.
